## second day tutorial notes 

in this we are going to create 'components' folder in 'src' folder

in 'components ' folder make '__init__.py' file

'__init__.py' file created for components created as package and can be used in other location so we can export import it

create "data ingetion" file  in components folder
data ingestion 
is nothing but to read data from different data bases and sources ,file location, different kind of data
and basically part of part of entire module.
(when we read data we divide data into train and test to train model and for validation)

create 'data_tranformation.py' file in components folder

create 'model_trainer.py' file in components folder

create 'pipeline' folder and
 in pipeline folder create'train_pipeline.py' file, 'predict_pipeline.py' file ,'__init__.py' file

 in src folder create the file 'logger.py', 'exception.py' and 'utils.py'

after writing code in 'logger' run it  and it will give logging information

after writing code in 'exception' run it and it will give you exception information
